          <br /> <span className="info-name">Regan Crowley</span>.
          <br /> I have fun working with Front end and backend development. I love to play Chess and I teach chess part time. 
          <br /> With all of my practicing I am able to recognise coding that is off and memorize the structure.
          <br /> I have a Bachelor of IT and a Diploma in software Development.
